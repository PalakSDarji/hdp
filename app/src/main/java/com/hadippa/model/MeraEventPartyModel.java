His favorite topics are Jaat culture, people who buy Royal Enfields and poverty, mostly his own. His friends say that the stories he narrates off stage are even funnier but we may never know. Gaurav claims to be a Bachelor of Art in Journalism and is understandably working in the retail sector. Having recently changed his name from Kapur to Kapoor, he is hoping being neurologically correct will add two inches to his height.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;\">Kabir Chandra<\/span><br /><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;\">Sales head for one of the country's leading music labels, Kabir also has been a radio jockey in his past avatars and responsible for being and honing some of India's very best on-air talent.

An event manager turned stand-up comedian, improviser and actor, she has made entertainment her new life's mission since nothing else is going for her!<\/p>\n<p>Ameya Deshpande<br />Ameya Deshpande is a comedian and the winner of #COME 15.<\/p>\n<p>Bhavish Ailani<br />Bhavish Ailani is Sindhi by birth and funny by profession. Being an MBA like almost everyone else, Bhavish does not rely too much on his education to make a living. Instead he uses observational comedy and self-deprecating humor to make life bearable. Veteran of over one hundred ridiculous shows, most of which he has hosted himself, this is pretty much the only thing he is good at. Like most comics on the circuit, Bhavish has recently gone through a break-up. So please show him some love and assume everything we've said here is true.<\/p>\n<p><br />Tanmay Bhat<br />Tanmay Bhat was only 17 years old when he started writing for papers like Mumbai Mirror,The Times Of India and WWM. By the time he was in college, Tanmay had started writing for television projects like Filmfare, India's Got Talent and MTV Wassup. He is one of the youngest stand-up comedians in India who got the opportunity to work with Vir Das and showcase his talent at the Comedy store. In 2011, he co-founded the All India Bakchod, a comedy collective with Gursimran Khamba. Tanmay Bhat will be seen performing at Royal Turd, Mumbai in September 2014.<\/p>","localityId":0,"url":"30-come-presented-by-ratatouille","thumbnailfileid":0,"bannerfileId":0,"categoryId":1,"subcategoryId":2,"pincode":400050,"registrationType":2,"eventMode":0,"timeZoneId":1,"venueName":"The Jeff Goldberg Studio","private":0,"status":1,"latitude":19.0549,"longitude":72.8284,"acceptmeeffortcommission":1,"bannerPath":"https://static.meraevents.com/content/eventbanner/110558/COME-logo-11478153882_banner1478500597.png","thumbnailPath":"https://static.meraevents.com/content/eventlogo/110558/COME-logo-11478153882_thumb1478500599.png","categoryName":"Entertainment","categoryThemeColor":"#ba36a6","defaultthumbnailPath":"https://static.meraevents.com/content/categorylogo/Entertainment1455567253.jpg","subCategoryName":"Music / Concerts / Live Performance","eventUrl":"https://www.meraevents.com/event/30-come-presented-by-ratatouille","tags":"Jeeya Sethi,comedy,music / concerts / live performance,entertainment,mumbai","bookMarked":0,"contactdetails":"","bookButtonValue":"Register Now","facebookLink":null,"googleLink":null,"twitterLink":null,"tnctype":"organizer","meraeventstnc":null,"organizertnc":null,"contactWebsiteUrl":null,"limitSingleTicketType":0,"salespersonid":null,"contactdisplay":0,"customvalidationfunction":null,"customvalidationflag":null,"countryId":14,"countryName":"India","stateId":20,"stateName":"Maharashtra","cityId":14,"cityName":"Mumbai","address1":"Bandra West","address2":"","timeZone":"","timeZoneName":"Asia/Kolkata","updated_at":"2016-11-09 15:24:55","created_at":"2016-11-09 15:24:55"},{"id":110559,"ownerId":373430,"startDate":"2016-11-24 14:30:00","endDate":"2016-11-24 16:30:00","title":"5 COME grand slam presented by Ratatouille","description":"<p><img src=\"https://static.meraevents.com/content/dashboard/tinymce/uploads/COME-logo-11478153882.png\" alt=\"\" /><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>5 COME grand slam presented by Ratatouille. an open mic Competition where the winners of previous come shows try to fight for the ultimate prise and become the COME Champion, History in the making you, this you want to be part of.<\/p>\n<p>Date 24th November<br />Time 830pm <br />Tickets cost Rs 250<br />Venue: Jeff Goldberg Studio (1st floor) 133 Gazebo House, Above mamagoto, Hill Road, Bandra (w)<\/p>\n<p><br />Artists <br />Host <br />Jeeya Sethi<\/p>\n<p>Winner&rsquo;s of COME<br />#25 Ankush Daiman<br />#26 Sushant Arora<br />#27 Masoom Rajwani<br />#28 <br />#29 <br />#30 <br />5 FemaPalooza Neetu Bhardwaj<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","localityId":0,"url":"5-come-grand-slam-presented-by-ratatouille","thumbnailfileid":0,"bannerfileId":0,"categoryId":1,"subcategoryId":2,"pincode":400050,"registrationType":2,"eventMode":0,"timeZoneId":1,"venueName":"The Jeff Goldberg Studio","private":0,"status":1,"latitude":19.0549,"longitude":72.8284,"acceptmeeffortcommission":1,"bannerPath":"https://static.meraevents.com/content/eventbanner/110559/COME-logo-11478153882_banner1478500556.png","thumbnailPath":"https://static.meraevents.com/content/eventlogo/110559/COME-logo-11478153882_thumb1478500558.png","categoryName":"Entertainment","categoryThemeColor":"#ba36a6","defaultthumbnailPath":"https://static.meraevents.com/content/categorylogo/Entertainment1455567253.jpg","subCategoryName":"Music / Concerts / Live Performance","eventUrl":"https://www.meraevents.com/event/5-come-grand-slam-presented-by-ratatouille","tags":"Jeeya Sethi,comedy,music / concerts / live performance,entertainment,mumbai","bookMarked":0,"contactdetails":"","bookButtonValue":"Register Now","facebookLink":null,"googleLink":null,"twitterLink":null,"tnctype":"organizer","meraeventstnc":null,"organizertnc":null,"contactWebsiteUrl":null,"limitSingleTicketType":0,"salespersonid":null,"contactdisplay":0,"customvalidationfunction":null,"customvalidationflag":null,"countryId":14,"countryName":"India","stateId":20,"stateName":"Maharashtra","cityId":14,"cityName":"Mumbai","address1":"Bandra West","address2":"","timeZone":"","timeZoneName":"Asia/Kolkata","updated_at":"2016-11-09 15:25:41","created_at":"2016-11-09 15:25:41"},{"id":110808,"ownerId":138652,"startDate":"2016-11-27 12:00:00","endDate":"2016-11-27 14:30:00","title":"Yacht Party","description":"<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;

Apart from a day job, the only thing he has going for him is that he is funny. So funny in fact that he has won every open mic competition on the Mumbai circuit including Big Mic, Canvas Laugh Club, Chalta Hai and Buzz Off and has opened for Russell Brand on his India tour. His favorite topics are Jaat culture, people who buy Royal Enfields and poverty, mostly his own. His friends say that the stories he narrates off stage are even funnier but we may never know. Gaurav claims to be a Bachelor of Art in Journalism and is understandably working in the retail sector. Having recently changed his name from Kapur to Kapoor, he is hoping being neurologically correct will add two inches to his height.</span></p>
